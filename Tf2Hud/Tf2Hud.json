    "Punchline": "[REQUIRES TF2 INSTALLED FOR MOST FEATURES] The Mann Brothers just found a deposit of gravel in Eorzea\nand hired YOU, Mercenary of Light, to help them FIGHT for it.",
    "Description": "* Show a Win Panel (with sounds!) when you clear or get wiped in a duty.\n* Show a TF2-style timer while in a duty.\n* Enable the \"Voice Lines\" module (via /tfconfig) to have voice lines play when certain conditions are met. What conditions, you ask? It's a surprise! (Unless you uncheck the \"Surprise me!\" box.)\n* More features maybe soon?\n\nNote: This plugin uses files from a local Team Fortress 2 installation.\nIt'll search for the game's installation folder in all configured Steam Library Folders automatically.\n\nWithout a TF2 install, the Timer and Win Panel will work with FF XIV fonts, and no voice line will work.",
